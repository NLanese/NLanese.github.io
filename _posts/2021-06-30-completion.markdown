Though I had learned a decent amount of coing before I had began Flatiorn, I did not fully understand what encompassed being a developer. Long nights; constantly having to check Slack or Stackoverflow; dealing with new gems, packets, and frameworks; and spending hours debugging one error certainly isn't for everyone. However, I cannot imagine myself doing anything else. I love to build and create things-- and I hate math so that rules out engineering.  Even despite that, I feel the computer science truly lends itself to have less of a constraint on it than any form of engineering. Computer Science can be used for everything, it's potential is limitless, only bound by the creativity of the developer. I am very excited to enter the working world and grow even more as a developer.
