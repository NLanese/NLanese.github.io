Finishing this project was an amazing feeling. Finally being able to see all the work I put into learning how to be a developer was a very cathartic experience. Thankfully by this point I have already learned the difficult lessons of how to debug properly and how to document as you code. This helped me complete this massive project in less than two weeks, which I think may actually be the quickest I have completed a project. For something with as many files as this, I actually had to draw out elaborate diagrams and follow along with it as I developed the app. This organization really came in handy, as sometimes after looking at everything for too long I would get 'coder's brain' and forget where everything went , and how the entrie ComponentTree was structured. Properly labeling and files and placing them in distinct files also helped.
