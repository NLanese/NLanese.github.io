It definetly wasn't my strong suit right away.  In fact I took my first legitimate coding class as a Junior in highschool, and creating a simple "Hello World" program took me hours. It was our summer assignment, and it was incredibly difficult to understand instructions about computer science and installing IDEs when you've never coded before, Luckily, I had an amazing teacher who was a great lecturer in person. 
I was a student who had taken 10 AP classes upon graduation, and found myself mostly interested in engineering or architecure, I loved the idea of creating something. However, the classes I was always best in were more the arts, literature, global studies, history and such were classes I generally thrived in but I never was passionate about any of them. I thrived in them because I know how to look at things from all angles and approaches, I pride myself on my ability to fully understand and analyze something. 
For a decent portion of time, we used a program called Alice to learn code and understand the logic behind things. I recall for a large project in the class, we just had to create our own "program" on Alice, and most kids did something simple. Press the Spacebar and a wheel spins. Move the mouse to click on three ducks. All very simple. I decided this was my opportunity to create something, as small and stupid as it may have been. For some reason, I really wanted to make something cool, I was legitimately interested in a school project and that was a rare occurance. I made a full first-person shooter, as you had a character with health, ammo, and zombies chasing you (well not chasing just moving randomly but hey we can't all start as experts). People in the class, and the teacher, were very impressed with it, in fact after that I would sometimes see kids playing it on their computers instead of working during later classes.
I loved that I could create with code. And the possibilities, practicalities and methods of coding are limitless. I loved that about it, and my ability to look at a problem or a subject from all angles definietly helps me when I code. If I face a problem that I just cannot seem to surmount, I just have to face it a different way.
It was something that I was good at, and something that I truly enjoyed being good at. That (plus the fact that software jobs pay well) is why I decided on coding as a career
