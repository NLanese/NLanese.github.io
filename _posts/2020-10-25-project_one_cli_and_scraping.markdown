Truth be told, getting this project started was tough. I wasn't fully understanding some of the instructions and some links inside the lessons didn't work. I did not know who my section lead was, and my Slack account did not work either, so I had some issues to tackle before I could even truly get started. I was deterred a bit, and rather than linger on the project I continued my lessons. After finishing module 10 I decided to try it again and this time moved much more quickly and confidently. I began with the scraping class because this was the class that essentially did the heaviest lifting. It's the one that created Team and Series objects. These two classes are based off of information gotten off the web inside of the Scraper class, so their values and code couldn't even be tested or checked until the Scraper was done. Completing the scraper took awhile, as finding the right values from the HTML document was an arduous series of testing values inside binding.pry. Once this was completed, it was relatively easy to finish the other classes. I worked on Team first, and then Series, since Series has two Team variables.
