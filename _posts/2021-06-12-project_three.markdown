Project three took me awhile for a couple of reasons, some were much more of my own doing than others. Foremost; I seldom documented my code much prior to this lab. My notes are very organized and I used to think that would cover it, if I spaced on my code for a week or worked on something else for a bit, I believed I'd be able to come back to my work, look at it once and figure out exactly what everything did-- after all, I wrote it. 
If you're thinking that was an extremely naive position, you're correct. I took a two week hiatus at one point, only to come back and ecide it was going to be more efficient to start from scratch, as my code was confusing and admittededly not too DRY. The second time around, I documented what each step was supposed to do, which also heped me in the debugging process. 
The second issue I faced was OmniAuth. I feel like it was poorly covered in the Self-Paced cirriculum in fairness, but I had coaches assist me and help me get througn that. 
The third issue was forms. I undertsood forms well enough that if need be I could just make a wildly inefficient form that still got the job done, but I wanted my code to be clean (ish at least) for this project. I refreshed my own notes, and started really looking into things on Stackoverflow. Through that struggle, not only do I command a better understanding of forms, but I now possess betting note taking practices and a better understanding of how to traverse and comprehend 'code google' like stakcoverflow or fullstack.
